# Stegno-Encoder-Decoder(SEDSUITE)

This is a Project which usually explore the area of Steganography and Cryptography.plication In this Project we will use the Concept of Data Hididng and Encryption & Decryption Concepts from Cryptography. It is also Known as one of the form stegnography called "generation". This Projects involves an development & production of an android & ios application which are able to take some text and convert it into some kind of image.
### Functionality of the application---
---->Encoder

        1. Take an input text or seceret text
        2. Encrypt it with any of cryptography algorithm.
        3. convert each word in a random image.
        4. Combine all image and make an composite image.
        5. Composite image as an output.

---->Decoder

        1.Take Composite Image as an Input
        2.seperate all the image 
        3.apply cryptography algorithm.
        4.decrypt the text.
        5.Plain text as an output.

### FrameWorks & Languages

    - [ ] Application Front-end - React-Native framework.
    [x] Back-end - NodeJs & python.
    [x] Database - MongoDB & Mongoose.
    [x] Uses of Rest-API Can be easily Seen.

The Whole Development of the application will be completed till 15th March 2021.
